- geopy
- json
- kmodes
- numpy
- pyqt5

- sklearn

## File Structure
- All .py files under the project folder are part of the prototype code.
- All .ui files under the project folder are UI prototype generated using Qt Designer app
- MapOutput.html will store the interactive map generated by dashboard while the dashboard is being used.
- In the raw_data folder are .xlsx files required by the dashboard.

## How to run the prototype dashboard
There are two ways two run the prototype. In both way, it is recommended to use a python venv to keep the main environment clean.

### 1. Easiest way:
1. Download the DataSystemProject_prototype folder, and cd to the folder in terminal
2. Activate a python venv that meets the dependencies
3. Run the following command
```
python main.py
```

### 2. Alternative way: Use PyCharm to run the code as a project
1. Download the DataSystemProject_prototype folder.
2. Open the folder as a project in PyCharm.
3. In PyCharm, choose a python venv as the project's python interpreter, and configure the venv to meet the environment reqirement. 
4. Run the project from PyCharm.
